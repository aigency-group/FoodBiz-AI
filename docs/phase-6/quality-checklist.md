## 1. Accessibility (A11y) Checklist

This checklist is based on WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] **1.1:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) are focusable and operable using only the keyboard.
- [ ] **1.2:** The focus order is logical and intuitive.
- [ ] **1.3:** The focus indicator is clearly visible and has a high contrast ratio.
- [ ] **1.4:** No keyboard traps exist; the user can navigate to and from all elements.

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- [ ] **2.1:** All non-text content (icons, images) has appropriate alternative text (`alt` attributes).
- [ ] **2.2:** Form inputs have associated, programmatically-linked labels.
- [ ] **2.3:** ARIA attributes are used correctly and sparingly to enhance (not replace) semantic HTML.
- [ ] **2.4:** Page titles are descriptive and unique.
- [ ] **2.5:** Headings are used hierarchically to structure content.

### Visual Design & Readability
- [ ] **3.1:** Color contrast for text and important UI elements meets a minimum ratio of 4.5:1 (AA).
- [ ] **3.2:** Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
- [ ] **3.3:** Information is not conveyed by color alone.

## 2. Performance Checklist

This checklist focuses on the frontend performance and user experience.

### Loading Performance
- [ ] **4.1:** Time to First Byte (TTFB) is under 500ms.
- [ ] **4.2:** First Contentful Paint (FCP) occurs in under 1.8 seconds.
- [ ] **4.3:** Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) occurs in under 2.5 seconds.
- [ ] **4.4:** The total JavaScript bundle size is minimized and code-split where possible.
- [ ] **4.5:** Images are optimized and served in modern formats (e.g., WebP).

### Runtime Performance
- [ ] **5.1:** Animations and transitions are smooth (aiming for 60 FPS).
- [ ] **5.2:** User input (e.g., typing in the chat) has a near-instant response.
- [ ] **5.3:** The application remains responsive and does not freeze during data fetching or processing.
- [ ] **5.4:** Memory usage is monitored and does not leak over time.
